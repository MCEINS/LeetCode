142. Linked List Cycle II


Medium


Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

```

```go

 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * type ListNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Next *ListNode
 * }
 */
func detectCycle(head *ListNode) *ListNode {
    if head == nil || head.Next == nil {
		return nil
	}

	slow, fast := head.Next, head.Next.Next
	for fast != nil && fast.Next != nil && slow != fast {
		slow, fast = slow.Next, fast.Next.Next
	}

	if slow != fast {
		return nil
	}

	for slow != head {
		slow, head = slow.Next, head.Next
	}
	return slow
}
```
