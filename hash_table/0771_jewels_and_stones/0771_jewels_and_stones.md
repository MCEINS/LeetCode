771. Jewels and Stones

Easy

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:
```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

Example 2:

```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

Note:


S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.

The characters in J are distinct.


# 方法
遍历 J，判断 S 中的字符是否在 J 中，若在，则结果 +1。


```go
func numJewelsInStones(J string, S string) int {
    isJewel := make(map[byte]bool, len(J))
	for i := range J {
		isJewel[J[i]] = true
	}

	res := 0
	for i := range S {
		if isJewel[S[i]] {
			res++
		}
	}

	return res
}
```


```python
class Solution(object):
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J, S):
        """
        :type J: str
        :type S: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        return sum(S.count(j) for j in J)
```
